# Banking-Statement-Analyzer
The Financial Statement Analyzer is a Python tool for parsing bank statements from ICICI Bank and SBI. It extracts account details, categorizes transactions, tracks end-of-day balances, and provides basic fraud detection. This project facilitates financial analysis and can be easily extended to support other banks.
